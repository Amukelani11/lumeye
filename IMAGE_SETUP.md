# Image Setup Guide for Lumeye E-commerce

## Current Status
The homepage has been enhanced with all the improvements you requested, but it's currently using placeholder images. To complete the setup, you'll need to add your actual product images.

## Images Needed

### 1. Hero Section Image (Most Important)
**File:** `public/hero-product.jpg` or `public/hero-product.png`
**Recommended:** Use your "lumeye shot 5.jpg" (the "Erase Puffiness in 60 Seconds" bottle shot)
**Size:** 400x500px minimum, high quality
**Update:** Replace the placeholder in `app/components/HeroSection.tsx` line 58

### 2. Before/After Gallery Images
**Files:** 
- `public/before-after-1-before.jpg`
- `public/before-after-1-after.jpg`
- `public/before-after-2-before.jpg`
- `public/before-after-2-after.jpg`
- `public/before-after-3-before.jpg`
- `public/before-after-3-after.jpg`

**Recommended:** Use your "lumeye shot 4.jpg" and other before/after shots
**Size:** 300x300px minimum, square format
**Update:** Replace placeholders in `app/components/BeforeAfterGallery.tsx` lines 7-15

## Quick Setup Steps

1. **Add Hero Image:**
   ```bash
   # Copy your hero image to public folder
   cp "lumeye shot 5.jpg" public/hero-product.jpg
   ```

2. **Update Hero Section:**
   ```typescript
   // In app/components/HeroSection.tsx, line 58
   src="/hero-product.jpg"  // instead of placeholder
   ```

3. **Add Before/After Images:**
   ```bash
   # Copy your before/after images
   cp "lumeye shot 4.jpg" public/before-after-1-after.jpg
   # Add more before/after pairs as needed
   ```

4. **Update Before/After Gallery:**
   ```typescript
   // In app/components/BeforeAfterGallery.tsx, update the image paths
   before: "/before-after-1-before.jpg",
   after: "/before-after-1-after.jpg",
   ```
